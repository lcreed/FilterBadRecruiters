Greetings,

I do not accept any communications from your agency.  In the past, you have spammed me with messages for jobs that do not line up with my skills and experience, are not 100% remote or do not include salary details. As a result, I do not view your agency as a credible source of employment prospects. This is an automated response to let you know that it has been flagged as spam and deleted without being seen. The same thing will happen to further emails you send. Failing to unsubscribe my email address from your list will continue to have your domain flagged as spam with Google. This will decrease your reach as all mail sent to a gmail subscriber may potentially go directly to spam.

Any messages with the following domain strings referenced in the headers will be automatically added to the list of banned domains:

* bullhornmail
* ceipal
* jobdiva
* jobopportunityforyou / joboppforyou
* conrep (all associated domains)


Your company made the open source list of bad recruiters:

Companies who continue to send unwanted email after the consumer requests to be unsubscribed from their lists can incur penalties from the US Federal Trade Commission.  Each email you send will be reported to the FTC:
