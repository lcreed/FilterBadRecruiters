Greetings,

As I did not give my consent to be added to your mailing list, your company is violating the US CAN-SPAM act. Therefore, I will report this email and any future emails from you to the Federal Trade Commission, your Internet Service Provider, and other relevant agencies that investigate violations and add offenders to email blacklists.

Any messages with the following domain strings referenced in the headers will be automatically added to the list of banned domains:

* bullhornmail
* ceipal
* jobdiva
* jobopportunityforyou / joboppforyou
* conrep (all associated domains)
* rediff (all associated domains)
