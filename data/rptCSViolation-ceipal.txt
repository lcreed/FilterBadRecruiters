I am writing to report that the spammer in the attached email is abusing your system in violation of your Terms of Service and various laws. This is to facilitate their spamming activities.  

I have no relationship with this spammer, and I have never heard of them before receiving their spam. I certainly have not given them permission to use my email address to gather my personal information for selling their services. Despite attempting to unsubscribe from their list, I have been unsuccessful.

I am sending this report with full details of your system's involvement in the attachment because your services are enabling their illegal activity.

As per your posted policies, I request that your customers cease and desist from spamming me, as this is a clear violation of the CAN-SPAM act. Any emails I receive via this domain are  being reported to the Federal Trade Commission, spam.org, the Texas Attorney General, and the email services that maintain email blacklists.

Despite extraordinary efforts to request Monster stop selling my details to 3rd parties, I continue to receive messages from vendors like this one who have paid Monster for my private data.  

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
