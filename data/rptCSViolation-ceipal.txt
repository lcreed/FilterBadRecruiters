Provider, this spammer is abusing your system, in violation of your ToS and various laws, in order to facilitate their spamming activities.

I have zero relationship with this spammer, have never heard of them prior to receiving their spam, and have certainly not given permission to have my email address (which of course never signs up for anything) scraped and put on a mailing list from which we have to unsubscribe in order to stop them from spamming us.  I have attempted to unsubscribe from their list with no success.  Based on the email address and phone number that this company is using to contact me, there is evidence they are using contact data illegally obtained via a breach of Linkedin.com.  

You are receiving this report with full details of your system's involvement in the attachment because they are sending their spam through you (ceipal).

Per your posted policies, I ask that your customers cease and desist spamming me as these are clear violations of the CAN-SPAM act.  All future emails I receive via your domain will be reported to both the Federal Trade Commission and the email services that maintain email blacklists.
